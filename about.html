                        I joined SAAS as a member of the CX committee and loved the inclusive supportive community. From seminars and lectures, I learned introductory data science techniques: visualization, cleaning, and modeling with linear regression. Currently, I’m a member of the Insight and Analytics community which aims to provide creative solutions for organizations on and off-campus.

                        I am a sophomore attending UC Berkeley and I really love the amazing community I have here! The incredible courses here taught me Python, Java, SQL, and more importantly, enabled me to see continuous development in technology field and what Computer Science is truly about.

                        Avolution Magazine is a student-run high school organization that provides an outlet for students to express their creativity by publishing writing, artworks, and photography submissions. As the Editor in Chief, I was responsible for delegating meetings, recruitment, and planning distribution process. I communicated with 20 writers, editors, designers, and other executives in the club as well as with teachers, sponsors, and publishers to ensure the publication timeline. I build a website (www.avolutionmagazine.com) for improving the publicity of the club for recruitment and advertising purposes and successfully oversaw the creation of 2 amazing publications with the themes “Youth” and “Technology”. I felt a strong sense of accomplishment and pride from the glossy paper and the smell of not-so-expensive ink!

                        At the AI4ALL summer program, I explored NLP, Computer Vision, Robotics, and Bioinformatics under the guidance of renowned female computer scientists. I learned to work with SKLearn classifiers such as K-nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, RandomForest, CNN. I learned about what technology could do and what we hope that it can do. This experience helped me decide to venture into the field of computer science with its boundless possibilities.

                        The program, consisting of Game Design Camp and Robotics Camp, teaches Gr. 6-9 students concepts about science, coding, and robotics design. I assisted the instructors with conflict resolution and conductive activities such as the spaghetti marshmallow challenge. This experience showed me the value of education and the analytic mindset in early education.

                        Working as a Barista in a fast-paced environment helped me developed strong communication skills and instincts in customer service. I also learned a little bit of latte art so feel free to talk to me about drink recommendations!

                        I was a part of the Byng Arts program at my high school, which provides enriched academic courses and focuses on areas of music, media, and literary arts. I learned to acknowledge the importance of creative problem solving and thinking outside the box. I remember utilizing the law of conservation of energy, gravitational model, and magnetism to illustrate the growth and conflict of a character for a literary analysis project. I also participated in student council, volunteered at the library for 5 years, performed music at senior homes, and developed interests in both arts and STEM, as a variety of course subjects.
